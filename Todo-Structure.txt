1. Introduction
	Prices as function of the search interest

2. Data 
	Where from, frequency, etc

3. High Frequency Data Analysis: Gold Prices Model
	--- Exploratory analysis (ACF, PACF) ---
	--- unit-root test ---
	--- autoarima model selection --- 
	--- model the residuals --- 

4. Low Frequenciy Data: VAR Model
	1. Exploratory Analysis (ACF, PACF)
	2. VAR Model
	--- VAR model not very good as search is not significant ---
	--- cannot 



TODO:
	1- change VAR model for the FD's instead of the prices themselves
	2- use AIC to determine lag order for the new VAR model 
	3-
